1) JAVASCRIPT-
    let is block scoped, var is function scoped
    Arrow functions solve this keyword issue
    Spread Operator splits array or object ,Rest Operator merge list of function arguments into array
    Destructuring assign multiple variables with array/object values
    Object and Arrays are reference types, others are primitive and copy value. Do copy the values by spread operator to copy one object to other.


2) COMPONENTS & UI BUILDING-
Basics -
    npx create-react-app proj-name
    index.js is loaded first, transforms code. public -> index.html is rendered on screen.
    react and react-dom forms react library

    Components are reusable building blocks and makes code maintainable. It is just a javascript function.
    JSX is javascript xml, a syntactic sugar. React.createElement(tag, attribute, data) was used earlier, hence only single tag can be returned in JSX
    Data is passed as Props(custom html attributes). Props are added as parameter in component.
    In React we write Declarative syntax

    REUSABLE COMPONENT- Ex- Modals, etc
    Wrapper component for common styling can be used by adding {props.children} in the Wrapper component like ng-content in angular i.e. content b/w closing and opening tag
    Classes of content can be added to the wrapper component by props.className
